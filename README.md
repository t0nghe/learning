# Learning Projects

This repository contains my personal learning projects. These are all long-term projects that I would like to do little by little. Ongoing projects include:

* Solving [LeetCode problems](https://leetcode.com) using Python and JavaScript. (See folder `[LeetCode](LeetCode/))`.)
* Taking the [CS50 Web Dev](https://cs50.harvard.edu/web/2020/) course.

## LeetCode

*LeetCode* challenges help you understand basic algorithms and data structures. I try to come up with my own solution before reading the discussion section and taking notes of interesting ideas that I can learn from. My LeetCode submissions are filed under the [LeetCode](LeetCode/) folder in this repo.

## CS50 Web Dev

*CS50 Web Programming with Python and JavaScript* teaches you the basics of Django, SQL and HTML/CSS/JavaScript. I will post my solutions to the projects here when the course is finished.

## Next up

*Full Stack Open*

[Full Stack Open](https://fullstackopen.com/en/) is an online course for JavaScript-based web development. I'll be sharing my exercise solutions under the [FSO](FSO/) folder in this repo.

*Hands-On Machine Learning*

In the meantime, I'm reading *Hands-On Machine Learning 2*. I will read selected chapters in this book to better understand machine learning and share my notes and exercises under the [handson](handson/) folder in this repo.

## Finished projects

* Coursera: Neural Networks and Deep Learning by deeplearning.ai (I even have a [certificate to show you](https://www.coursera.org/account/accomplishments/verify/FRE6BU2SZVGX).)
