# Learning Projects

This repository contains my personal learning projects. These are all long-term projects that I would like to do little by little. Ongoing projects include:

* Solving [LeetCode problems](https://leetcode.com) using Python and JavaScript.
* Taking the [Full Stack Open](https://fullstackopen.com/en/) course. 
* Reading selected chapters in [Hands-On Machine Learning 2](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/hands-on-machine-learning/9781492032632/). 

## LeetCode

*LeetCode* challenges help you understand basic algorithms and data structures. I try to come up with my own solution before reading the discussion section and taking notes of interesting ideas that I can learn from. My LeetCode submissions are filed under the [LeetCode](LeetCode/) folder in this repo.

## Full Stack Open

*Full Stack Open* is an online course for JavaScript-based web development. I'll be sharing my exercise solutions under the [FSO](FSO/) folder in this repo.

## Hands-On Machine Learning

In the meantime, I'm reading *Hands-On Machine Learning 2*. I will read selected chapters in this book to better understand machine learning and share my notes and exercises under the [handson](handson/) folder in this repo.
